    <p>
        The scatterplot visualises the relationship between populations and housing transactions for each states in Malaysia. The calculated <b>R Squared value is 0.365584789</b> 
        (calculated in Excel) where it shows a <b>weak relationship between housing transactions and population</b> for each states in Malaysia while only 36.6% of the variance in 
        housing transactions can be explained by the population. We can assume that the relationship between this 2 factors may due to other factors. Each point represents a single state,
        with population and housing markets.

        <p>The stacked bar chart depicts the comparison between average salaries and houing markets across different states in Malaysia.
            With <b>high income states, Kuala Lumpur</b> but have lower housing transactions probably due to market saturation or etc. 
            and <b>mid-income states like Johor and Perak</b> remain vibrant housing markets and ongoing development projects.

        <div id = "donut_chart"></div>
        <p>The donut chart visualises the population share of each states in Malaysia, which shows an intuitive view of how people are distributed across Malaysia. From the chart,
            <b>Selangor</b> clearly dominates the chart as the Malaysia's <b>most populous state</b> due to the extensive urbanisation, job opportunities and infrastructure
            and <b>Putrajaya</b> has the lowest population as it mainly to host government ministries.
