    <h1>Overview of Population, Housing Market Trends, and Average Income in Malaysia (2023)</h1>

            <div class = "container">
            <p>The proportional map illustrates the population and housing transactions across all states in Malaysia for year 2023. 
                States with larger circle represents higher populations while the saturation colour of the circle represents the housing transactions
                which providing a clear and intuitive overview of demographic difference. We can notice that <b>Selangor having the largest circle</b> which represents
                having the highest population while <b>Johor have the highest rate of housing transactions</b>.
            </p>

    <div class = "container">
    <div id = "scatterplot"></div>
    <p>
        The scatterplot visualises the relationship between populations and housing transactions for each states in Malaysia. The calculated <b>R Squared value is 0.365584789</b> 
        (calculated in Excel) where it shows a <b>weak relationship between housing transactions and population</b> for each states in Malaysia while only 36.6% of the variance in 
        housing transactions can be explained by the population. We can assume that the relationship between this 2 factors may due to other factors. Each point represents a single state,
        with population and housing markets.
    </p>

    <div class = "container">
        <div id = "stacked_bar_chart"></div>
        <p>The stacked bar chart depicts that the relationship between average salaries and houing markets across different states in Malaysia.
            We can notice that some <b>high income states for example Kuala Lumpur</b> but have lower housing transactions probably due to market saturation or etc. 
            In other hand, <b>mid-income states like Johor and Perak</b> remain vibrant housing markets and ongoing development projects. We also can notice that <b>Putrajaya</b> has 
            a high salary but extremely low housing transaction which possibly due to limited residential area.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "container">
        <div id = "donut_chart"></div>
        <p>The donut chart visualises the population share of each states in Malaysia, which shows an intuitive view of how people are distributed across Malaysia. From the chart,
            we can notice that <b>Selangor</b> clearly dominates the chart as the Malaysia's <b>most populous state</b> due to the extensive urbanisation, job opportunities and infrastructure.
            Follow by <b>Johor and Sabah</b> possibly due to its significant land areas. The size of each segment represents relative populations for that states.
